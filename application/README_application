This folder contains an application that can be downloaded onto a windows operated computer, to help visualise digital recordings of heart sounds. 

Open the application, and one can upload a '.wav' file of recorded heart sounds. The application will then allow the downloading of a pdf report that contains the associated fourier transform plot and spectrogram generated from the recording. 

Any questions to n.r.lawrence@sheffield.ac.uk
