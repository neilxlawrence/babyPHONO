PHONOviewer README

PHONOviewer.exe is open-source software designed to make heart sound visualisation more accessible. The file can be run on a windows computer. 

This application analyses the length of an uploaded recording and produces a spectrogram and fourier transform plot designed to aid analysis of digital recordings of heart sounds.
Please note that this is a test version of the program. The output from this program is not to be used for clinical decision making.
